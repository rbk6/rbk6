# Hey, I'm Ryan! 👋

I'm a recent college graduate passionate about web development, excited to embark on my journey in the tech industry.

## About Me

- 🎓 Recent graduate in Computer Science from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas
- 💻 Aspiring web developer with a focus on full-stack development
- 🌟 Constantly learning and exploring new technologies

## Current Project: SlateList

SlateList is my ongoing web app project, designed to tackle a common problem: keeping track of your movie and TV show preferences.

- 📽️ **Rate and Review:** Never forget your favorite movies and shows by adding ratings and reviews.
- 📋 **Create Lists:** Organize your must-watches, recommendations, and more in one place.
- 📣 **Never Miss a Recommendation:** Say goodbye to forgotten suggestions. SlateList helps you keep track of what to watch next.

My goal with this project is to make managing your entertainment preferences easier.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback. Happy watching!
